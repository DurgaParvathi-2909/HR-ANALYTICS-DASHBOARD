## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide insights into employee patterns within an organization. This tool aims to help HR departments understand attrition and retention rates, identify factors affecting employee engagement, and develop strategies to enhance organizational growth and performance.

# Situation
The HR department is facing challenges in understanding employee patterns. There is a pressing need to improve employee engagement, which directly impacts the growth and performance of the company.

# Task
As an HR Data Analyst, I developed an interactive HR dashboard that addresses the following key questions:

How many active employees are currently in the company?   
What are the annual attrition and retention rates?  
How many employees demonstrate loyalty to the company?  
What are the primary reasons behind employee departures?
