# Insights

𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The total number of employees leaving the company is 237. This high attrition rate might indicate issues within the organization that need addressing.

𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐲 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Employees with a performance rating of 3 have the highest attrition. This suggests that average-performing employees might be less satisfied or engaged, leading to their departure.

𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫: There are disparities in monthly income across different job roles and between genders, which could indicate potential pay inequality or role-specific satisfaction issues.

𝐒𝐮𝐦 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: The Sales & Development department has the highest attrition rate, followed by Research & Development. This could point to specific departmental challenges or a stressful work environment in these areas.

𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐀𝐠𝐞 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐬: The attrition rate differs significantly by age and gender, with younger age groups (under 25) showing nearly equal attrition rates between males and females, while in older age groups, males tend to have higher attrition rates.

𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Employees who received higher salary hikes are less likely to leave, suggesting that salary increments can be an effective retention strategy.

# Recommendations
𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐬: Investigate the high attrition rates in Sales & Development and Research & Development departments to identify specific challenges and develop targeted retention strategies.

𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Focus on engagement and retention strategies for employees with average performance ratings to prevent their departure.

𝐏𝐚𝐲 𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Conduct a thorough review of salary structures to ensure fairness and equity across different job roles and genders. Consider implementing more frequent and transparent salary reviews.

𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬: Develop tailored retention strategies based on age and gender data. For instance, provide mentoring and career development opportunities to younger employees and flexible work arrangements to older employees.
